            <p class="doanvan"></p>
            <p class="doanvan">The attractions in Hue are based across the countryside so getting around is something to consider. Your options are:

                Hiring a scooter from 100,000 VND (£3) a day.
                Taking a day tour. Your accommodation and all the tourism offices in town will offer day tours by car or scooter from $13.
                Freestyle like we did! We used the Grab app to call very affordable bikes to take us between attractions, and hailed metered taxis in areas where this wasn’t possible.</p>

            <h1 class="top">Morning: Visit The Imperial City</h1>
            <p class="doanvan"> Otherwise known as the Citadel, this is without a doubt Hue’s most popular attraction and one you shouldn’t miss. When I passed through Hue for a day in 2015 it was basically the only thing I did!
                The Citadel was the centre of the last imperial dynasty of Vietnam which only ended in 1945. Since then, the Hue Citadel has seen two wars and been virtually destroyed and rebuilt. You can spend a good few hours exploring the various temples, gates and courtyards, some of which are insanely detailed and colourful.
                Entrance price: 150,000 VND (£5).</p>

            <h1 class="top">Afternoon: Explore The Royal Temple of Tu Duc</h1>
            <p class="doanvan"> The most interesting and shocking fact I learnt was that all 200 of the men who helped bury Emperor Tu Duc were beheaded to keep the location safe from grave robbers. Not only did Tu Duc have 104 wives, the forced labour involved in building his tomb caused an uprising which was suppressed. It sounds like he was an extremely powerful (and evil!) man in his lifetime…

                Entrance price: 100,000 VND (just over £3).</p>

            <h1 class="top">Evening: Tu Hieu Pagoda</h1>
            <p class="doanvan"> Just a seven-minute drive from Tu Duc is this much quieter and smaller temple site. It isn’t nearly as grand but it’s a nice contrast – entrance was free and we were the only people there!

                Around 70 monks live at this pagoda nestled within the surrounding pine forest. They chant several times a day so you might be lucky and catch them mid ritual. If you’re visiting Tu Duc, definitely stop by.</p>

            <h1 class="top">Night: Shopping at Hanoi Weekend Night Market</h1>
            <p class="doanvan"> After returning to your hotel for a quick rest, it’s time to indulge on some retail therapy and street food at the Hanoi Weekend Night Market. Located in Old Quarter, this bustling gathering of roadside stalls starts at 19:00 onwards, running from Hang Dao Street to the edge of Dong Xuan Market. Pedestrian streets and historical sites within the area are illuminated with decorative lights, making this a popular spot for travelling photographers. Shopping-wise, you will find inexpensive t-shirts, handicrafts, accessories, shoes, sunglasses and souvenirs, but make sure to bargain hard (at least 50% lower than the original price) to get the best deal.</p>

            <h1 class="top">The Abandoned Waterpark at Ho Thuy Thien Lake</h1>
            <p class="doanvan"> Located just 8km south of the ancient city of Hue, the Ho Thuy Tien waterpark was built by the Hue Tourism Company in 2004 for a total cost of 70 billion dong ($30m) and was tipped to be the region’s go-to tourist attraction but was never completed.

                Ownership was later transferred to the HACO Company in 2013 with proposals to rebuild the site as an area for eco-tourism, only for these plans to again stall and never reach full fruition.

            <h1 class="top">The Tomb of Khai Dinh</h1>
            <p class="doanvan"> The most interesting thing about Khai Dinh? The outside it’s entirely made from grey stone but once you get inside it’s SO colourful and detailed! You’d never expect it from the outside. Khai Dinh was the 12th emperor of the Nguyen Dynasty meaning it’s one of the newest tombs at just under 100 years old.The stone soldiers and elephants in the outside grounds are a reason to visit – as are the views from the top over the green countryside and mountains! I think this was my favourite tomb in Hue due to the colourful interior.

                Like many of the Hue tombs, the people of the time paid for the construction. Taxes were raised to 30% whilst it was being built, something people were unhappy about as Khai Dinh was so unpopular. Vietnam was under French rule and people described him as a puppet to the French.
                
                Entrance: 100,000 VND.</p>
